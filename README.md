# Trafiklab openApi documentation
This repository contains the OpenApi documentation for the Trafiklab APIs.

## Contributing
We welcome all contributions in the form of issues and pull requests.

### When creating an issue
Please explain the problem in a clear way: is documentation missing, is documentation wrong? What did you expect to find, what did you find instead? Include examples when possible.

### When creating a pull request
Please refer to an issue number in every commit, by using Githubs '#123' format, where 123 is the issue number. When creating the pull request, clearly describe what you changed and why. An example would be 'Changed name field in example-api from integer to string, in order to match the documentation with the actual response', or 'Changed the description of example-api to fix typos'.

## About OpenApi
OpenApi, formerly known as Swagger, is a standard for defining how to interact with APIs, and which responses to expect. It allows for easy visualisation of an API on an interactive webpage, or for direct code generation through open-source tools.
